\section{Dataset Information}
The input dataset is the HSC Strategic Survey Program (SSP) Public Data Release 1 (PDR1) \citep{2017arXiv170208449A}.
The PDR1 dataset has been transferred to the LSST GPFS storage /datasets by \jira{DM-9683} and the butler repo is available at /datasets/hsc/repo.

It includes 5654 visits in 7 bands: HSC-G, HSC-R, HSC-I, HSC-Y, HSC-Z, NB0816, NB0921. Their visit IDs are visitId-SSPPDR1.txt.  The official release site is at https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/
The survey has three layers and includes 8 fields.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
UDEEP: SSP{\_}UDEEP{\_}SXDS, SSP{\_}UDEEP{\_}COSMOS
\item
DEEP: SSP{\_}DEEP{\_}ELAIS{\_}N1, SSP{\_}DEEP{\_}DEEP2{\_}3, SSP{\_}DEEP{\_}XMM(S){\_}LSS, SSP{\_}DEEP{\_}COSMOS
\item
WIDE: SSP{\_}WIDE, SSP{\_}AEGIS
\end{enumerate}

The number of visits in each field and band is summarized in the following table.
\input{datasetTable}

The tract IDs for each field is summarized in the following table.
\input{tractTable}

Plots of tracts and patches can be found on  https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/index.php/data/. In S17B, more tracts than listed were processed.

\section{Hardware}
The processing was done using the Verification Cluster.
The Verification Cluster consists of 48 Dell C6320 nodes with 24 physical cores (2 sockets, 12 cores per processor) and 128 GB RAM. As such, the system provides a total of 1152 physical cores.
lsst-dev01 is a system with 24 physical cores, 256 GB RAM, running the latest CentOS 7.x that serves as the front end of the Verification Cluster.

The Verification Cluster runs the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) cluster management and job scheduling system. lsst-dev01 runs the SLURM controller and serves as the login or head node , enabling LSST DM users to submit SLURM jobs to the Verification Cluster.

lsst-dev01 and the Verification Cluster utilize the General Parallel File System (GPFS) to provided shared-disk across all of the nodes. The GPFS will have spaces for archived datasets and scratch space to support computation/analysis.
